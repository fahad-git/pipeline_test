# Pipeline Test

Pipeline Test is a foundational **Next.js** project that serves as a testing and experimentation environment for building React-based web applications with advanced deployment pipelines. The repository is designed to test CI/CD integrations, evaluate pipeline configurations, and ensure smooth automation for future web projects.

---

## Purpose

- **CI/CD Testing:** Validate and test Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.
- **Next.js Exploration:** Experiment with features like Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).
- **Scalability:** Serve as a base for scalable web applications with optimized production builds.
- **Development Framework:** Provide a robust framework for front-end development with modern JavaScript practices.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Package Manager:** npm or Yarn
- **Build Tool:** Webpack (via Next.js configuration)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules (default setup via Next.js)
- **Testing Framework:** Jest (Optional or to be implemented)

---

## Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Enhance performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Pre-render pages at build time for improved load times.
- **API Routes:** Built-in API endpoints to handle backend logic within the same project.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Optimize load times by loading only necessary components.
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Facilitate rapid development by updating modules without a full reload.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **npm or Yarn:** Package managers for JavaScript.

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fahad-git/pipeline_test.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd pipeline_test
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

---

## Usage

To start the development server:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

After building, you can start the production server with:

Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```
